# My projects

## [KaktusGame.eu][https://kaktusgame.eu]

I made this website as "challenge" for myself. It's mainly written in HTML, CSS and little bit of JavaScript. I use [Google fonts][https://fonts.google.com/] for font styles, with colors I got mainly help from my friend Probin. It's simple website, but I never wanted to make it complicated. I'm planning to add some more features in the future.

## [Meteor game](https://github.com/Kaktus1549/Meteor-Game)

As my start of programming in Python, I made this simple 2D game with help of library called ["replit-play"](https://pypi.org/project/replit-play/). It's simple game, where you have to avoid meteors falling from the sky. You can control your spaceship with WASD keys. The code is probably terrible written, but it was my first bigger project in Python.

## Discord bots

I have made some Discord bots, but all of them are private repositories right now. I am using [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library for making them. You can check some of my bots on Eternal Gaming discord server -> [Eternal Gaming](https://discord.gg/eternalgaming)
