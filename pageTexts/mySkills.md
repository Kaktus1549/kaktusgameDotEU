# My skills

## Programming

I started programming in 2020 with Python which is my main programming language to this day. In school we are learning C#. In the future I would like to learn at least Java. I also have some experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and bash scripting.

## Networking

I am learning networking since 2022, when I started visiting CCNA courses at ÄŒVUT (Czech Technical University in Prague). Currently I have CCNA 1 and CCNA 2 certificates and I have enrolled in CCNA 3 course in the moment of writing this. We are also learning networking in school, but it is not as advanced as the CCNA courses.

## Other

Since I am studying cybersecurity, I have some experience with Linux (Debian, Kali Linux, CentOS, ...), virtualization (VMware, parallels, ...) and other stuff related to cybersecurity. I am currently helping with server administration at [Eternal Gaming](https://discord.gg/4EXfUmkdKD).
