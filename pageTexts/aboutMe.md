# About me page

Hey! Hey! Glad to see you on my site. My name is Andrew, but I'm better known online as Kaktus (or Kaktus1549) and I'm currently studying cybersecurity in high school. I'm mostly interested in computers (networking, programming, ...), modern history (events like the Gulf War, Battle of Mogadishu, Operation Neptune Spear, etc.), or airplanes. I created this site as a "challenge" for myself and it would not have been possible without my friends.
